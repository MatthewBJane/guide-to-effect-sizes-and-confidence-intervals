    "text": "Welcome\nThis effect sizes and confidence intervals collaborative guide aims to provide academics, students and researchers with hands-on, step-by-step instructions for calculating effect sizes and confidence intervals for common statistical tests used in the behavioral, cognitive and social sciences, particularly when original data are not available and when reported information is incomplete. It also introduces general background information on effect sizes and confidence intervals, as well as useful R packages for their calculation. Many of the methods and procedures described in this Guide are based on R or R-based Shiny Apps developed by the science community. We were motivated to focus on R as we aim to maximize the reproducibility of our research outcomes and encourage the most reproducible study planning and data analysis workflow, though we also document other methods whenever possible for the reference of our readers. We regularly update this open educational resource, as packages are updated frequently and new packages are developed from time to time in this rapidly changing Open Scholarship era."

    "text": "Introduction\nEffect sizes and confidence intervals are critical metrics for interpreting results and quantifying the magnitude of findings in scientific research. However, calculating these values can be challenging, particularly when original data are unavailable or results are incompletely reported in prior publications. To address this need, our collaborative guide provides hands-on instructions for calculating effect sizes and confidence intervals for common statistical tests in the behavioral, cognitive, and social sciences. Our guide includes background information on these concepts as well as recommendations for useful R packages that can automate many of these computations. R is emphasized due to its capabilities for reproducible analyses; however, we also cover alternative methods for those without expertise in R. This guide is intended to be an evolving open educational resource, updated as new methods and packages become available in this fast-changing era of open scholarship. By compiling these applied instructions, our goal is to enable students and researchers to easily obtain these metrics, facilitating robust and transparent quantification of results, as well as cumulative scientific progress.\n\nGuidelines for contribution\nAll are encouraged to contribute to this Guide.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Effect sizes quantify the magnitude of effects (i.e., strength of a relationship, size of a difference), which are the outcomes of our empirical research. Effect sizes are by no means a new concept. However, reporting them remained largely optional for many years, and only until recently does it become a community standard: scientists now see reporting effect sizes (in addition to the traditional statistical significance) as a must and journals also start to require such reporting. Notably, in 2001 and 2010, The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association 5th and 6th editions emphasized that it is “almost always necessary” (Divine et al. 2018) to report effect sizes (APA 2010, 34; see Fritz, Morris, and Richler 2012, which provides a comprehensive summary on history and importance of effect size reporting).\nEffects sizes can be grouped in broad categories as (1) raw effect sizes, and (2) standardized effect sizes. The raw effect sizes are a summary of the results that are expressed in the same units as the raw data. For example, when kilograms are measured, a raw effect size reports a measure in kilograms. Consider the effect of a diet on a treatment group; a control group receives no diet. The change in weight can be expressed as the mean difference between the groups. This measure is also in kg and so is a raw effect size. Standardized effect sizes expressed on a standardized scale which has no longer any unit but which have a universal interpretation. A z score is an example of a standardized measure. This document is concerned exclusively on standardized effect sizes.\n\n\n\n\nAPA. 2010.

    "text": "Sawilowsky (2009) expanded Cohen’s benchmarks to include very small effects (\\(d\\) = 0.01), very large effects (\\(d\\) = 1.20), and huge effects (\\(d\\) = 2.0). It has to be noted that very large and huge effects are very rare in experimental social psychology.↩︎\nAccording to this recent meta-analysis on the effect sizes in social psychology studies, “It is recommended that correlation coefficients of .1, .25, and .40 and Hedges’ \\(g\\) (or Cohen’s \\(d\\)) of 0.15, 0.40, and 0.70 should be interpreted as small, medium, and large effects for studies in social psychology.↩︎\nNote, for paired samples, this does not refer to the probability of an increase/decrease in paired samples but rather the probability of a randomly sampled value of X. This is also referred to as the “relative” effect in the literature. Therefore, the results will differ from the concordance probability provided below.↩︎\nThese benchmarks are also recommended by Gignac and Szodorai (2016). Funder and Ozer (2019) expanded them to also include very small effects (\\(r\\) = .05) and very large effects (\\(r\\) = .40 or greater). According to them, […] an effect-size \\(r\\) of .05 indicates an effect that is very small for the explanation of single events but potentially consequential in the not-very-long run, an effect-size r of .10 indicates an effect that is still small at the level of single events but potentially more ultimately consequential, an effect-size \\(r\\) of .20 indicates a medium effect that is of some explanatory and practical use even in the short run and therefore even more important, and an effect-size \\(r\\) of .30 indicates a large effect that is potentially powerful in both the short and the long run. A very large effect size (r = .40 or greater) in the context of psychological research is likely to be a gross overestimate that will rarely be found in a large sample or in a replication.” But see here for controversies with this paper.↩︎\nThe benchmarks for Cramer’s V are dependent on the size of the contingency table on which the effect is calculated. According to Cohen, use benchmarks for phi coefficient divided by the square root of the smaller dimension minus 1. For example, a medium effect for a Cramer’s V from a 4 by 3 table would be .3 / sqrt(3 - 1) = .21.↩︎"

No matter what tool you used to calculate your effect size (R is the most recommended tool here), you must make sure that others can easily follow your procedures and obtain the same results. This means that if you use online calculators (which is discouraged) or standalone programs (JAMOVI is most recommended; you can also use JASP, which however does not allow access to syntax at this moment), you should include screenshots that capture the input and output, with clear explanations. If you use R, Python or other programming languages, you should copy-and-paste your codes into your supplementary document (or submit your scripts to open online repositories), ideally with annotations and comments explaining the codes. inputs and outputs."

    "text": "3.2 Directionality\nSome effect sizes are directional (e.g., Cohen’s \\(d\\), Pearson correlations \\(r\\)), which means that they can be positive or negative. Their signs carry important information, and therefore cannot be omitted. When you report these effect sizes, make it clear what is compared to what (i.e., the direction of comparison). Better still, make sure your comparison is inline with the theory. For instance, a theory predicts that your group X should score higher on an item than your Group Y,1 you should hypothesize accordingly that Group X will have a higher mean than Group Y on the item, and subtract mean(Y) from mean(X) (rather than the other way around) to obtain the mean difference. You should then expect your \\(t\\) statistic to be positive, and your \\(d\\) value as well. In other words, avoid reporting anything like \\(t\\) = -5.14, \\(d\\) = 0.36, where the signs of the statistics do not match."

It might also be estimated with little confidence on the resulting number. This may be the case for example when the sample is very small, when the population displays a lot of variability, when a between-group design is used instead of a paired-sample design, and finally, when clustered sampling is used instead of randomized sampling. Precision can be estimated using various tools, but probably the most commonly used one is the Confidence intervals. This interval has a confidence level, frequently 95%."

    "text": "Of course, if a theory/effect predicts Group X has a higher mean than Group Y, then it also predicts the reverse, i.e., Group Y has a lower mean than Group X. But theories/effects are commonly articulated in a certain way. It is more common that we say, for example, people prefer the status quo rather than that people do not prefer the non-status quo, when we refer to the status quo bias. Consider another “theory”: teenagers get taller when they get older. It just does not make sense to say the same thing reversely, i.e., teenagers get shorter when they get younger, because people cannot get younger, at least in the 2020s.↩︎"

    "section": "",
    "text": "What is the correct interpretation of a confidence interval? Imagine you conducted a study where you compared two groups. You obtained a Cohen’s \\(d\\) = 0.3, 95% CI [0.2, 0.4]. How do you interpret this confidence interval?\nConfidence intervals are yielded by a certain procedure, such that when the procedure is repeatedly applied to a series of hypothetical datasets drawn from the studied population/populations, it yields intervals that contain the true parameter value (in our example, it means the true difference between the two groups) in 95% of the cases. For the effect estimate and confidence intervals to be valid, the data and test must meet the assumptions of the estimating procedure.\nIn colloquial terms, if we conduct this research over and over (repeating the same sampling procedure, administering the same experimental manipulation, conducting the same statistical analysis, etc.), because of sampling variability (our samples are slightly different at each time), we will get different Cohen’s \\(d\\) values. For each of these \\(d\\) values, we calculate a 95% interval. Then, among all these many intervals, we expect that 95% of them will contain the true \\(d\\), which we never know exactly.\nThere is also a common criticism levied against the confidence interval interpretation: “There is a 95% probability that the true parameter exists within the 95% confidence interval”. However this criticism is unwarranted in the specific case of a single observed confidence interval, that is, as long as there is a single realized confidence interval sampled from the population, this interpretation is fine (Vos and Holbert 2022). It is important to note however, this interpretation is incorrect when there are multiple realized confidence intervals randomly sampled from the same population. The criticized interpretation also tends to be more practical than the interpretation using repeated sampling, the following example described by Vos and Holbert (2022) illustrates this,\n\nThe distinction between these interpretations can be understood with the simple example of the probability of rolling a ‘6’ with a fair die. The probability is 1/6 because if you roll the die repeatedly the proportion of times that the face with ‘6’ comes up will be come very close to 1/6. Or, the probability is 1/6 because it is equivalent to a random selection from an urn where exactly one of 6 balls is labelled with ‘6’. The distinction in this simple example is less useful since repeatedly rolling a die is less problematic than repeatedly conducting the same randomized trial.\n\nFor further reading on confidence interpretations, see Hoekstra et al. (2014) and Morey et al. (2016).\n\n\n\n\nHoekstra, Rink, Richard D. Morey, Jeffrey N.

    "text": "Confidence intervals must be calculated and reported for every effect size that you obtained and mentioned in your manuscript. If you are doing a replication and your target article/study did not report CIs for its effect sizes, you should calculate CIs and report them.\nNormally, we calculate 95% confidence intervals (i.e., 95% of such intervals are expected to contain the true parameter value if we conduct an infinite number of identical studies). Nonetheless, for some effect sizes (e.g., eta-squared, partial eta-squared, R-squared), we calculate 90% confidence intervals. This is because \\(\\eta^2\\) is squared and always positive, and F-tests are one-sided. Reporting 95% CI for eta squared may result in situations in which the CI includes zero but the p-value falls below .05, whereas reporting 90% CI prevents such a problem. For further information regarding this issue, read Daniel Lakens blog on confidence intervals and Steiger (2004).\nConfidence intervals should be reported immediately after an effect size, e.g., Cohen’s d = 0.40, 95% CI [0.20, 0.60]. After the first time reporting them in a manuscript, every subsequent CI can be simply denoted by brackets without the “95% CI” preceding it.\nUnless you are measuring something that is meaningful in real life (e.g., income, years of experience, amount that a person is willing to donate), please make sure that the CI you calculated is a CI of the effect size, not of other statistics, such as the test statistics or mean difference in raw units.\nIf you see one of the following:\n\nYour effect size estimate does not fall in your confidence interval: you certainly have an issue. This can occur for example, if the width of the CI can be smaller than the tolerance of the optimizer, resulting in CIs of width 0.\nOne of your CI bound is “infinite”\nYour effect size estimate is not included within your CI (for comparison between two groups): You have an issue, check carefully. For means and for difference in means, the estimate should be precisely the midpoint of your CI; for other statistics (e.g., correlation, proportion, frequency, standard deviation), one arm might be longer than the other so the estimate may not be the midpoint.\n\nFor further reading related to the calculaton and reporting of effect sizes and confidence intervals, see Steiger (2004) and Lakens (2014).\n\n\n\n\nLakens, Daniël. 2014. “The 20.” http://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2014/06/calculating-confidence-intervals-for.html.\n\n\nSteiger, James H. 2004. “Beyond the f Test: Effect Size Confidence Intervals and Tests of Close Fit in the Analysis of Variance and Contrast Analysis.” Psychological Methods 9 (2): 164–82. https://doi.org/10.1037/1082-989X.9.2.164."

The open source nature means community-driven innovation and packages.\nVisualizations: R makes it easy to create publication-quality graphics to visualize your results.\nScripting: Automating analyses through R scripts improves efficiency and consistency.\nRange of packages: Packages like effectsize, MBESS, metafor, and more contain a variety of effect size and CI functions.\n\nMany (if not all) of these advantages are shared with Python and a number of other programming languages. While online calculators or GUI software can also allow calculating confidence intervals and effect sizes, open-source software such as R provide transparency, reproducibility, and access to a vast array of techniques.

To obtain citations for packages, you can use the citation() function and input the name of the package as a string.\n\nMOTE (Buchanan et al. 2019): This is a highly recommended package for calculating effect sizes, which is capable of handling a wide variety of effect sizes in the difference family (the d family) and variance-overlap family (r, eta, omega, epsilon). The functions also provide non-central confidence intervals for each effect size and output in APA style in LaTeX. MOTE has an online shiny application (doomlab.shinyapps.io/mote/). The CRAN project can be found here: cran.r-project.org/package=MOTE.\neffectsize (Ben-Shachar, Lüdecke, and Makowski 2020): This package is particularly useful in data analysis. A major advantage of this package is that it takes in many different model objects and directly outputs effect sizes and CIs. It also does some conversion. The CRAN project can be found here: cran.r-project.org/package=effectsize.\nMBESS (Kelley 2022): One of the most comprehensive and useful packages for effect size and confidence interval calculations.

The CRAN project can be found here: cran.r-project.org/package=psych.\nesc (Lüdecke 2019): This package can help convert among different effect sizes (pp. 4-12 in the reference manual). It’s also helpful when only incomplete information (e.g., only descriptives, or only p-values) have been provided in the paper, and we want to calculate effect sizes from them. Another package that provides similar conversion functions is the compute.es package. The CRAN project can be found here: cran.r-project.org/package=esc.\npsychmeta (Dahlke and Wiernik 2019): This package is mainly used for psychometric meta-analyses. It has a function for converting different effect sizes/test statistics (convert_es, p. 38 in the reference manual), including \\(r\\), \\(d\\), \\(t\\)-statistic (and its p-value), \\(F\\) (and its p-value in two-group one-way ANOVA), chi-squared (one degree of freedom), etc., to \\(r\\), \\(d\\) and the common language effect sizes (CLES, A, AUC).

Dividing the mean difference by the pooled standard deviation, \\(S_p\\), is the classic formulation of Cohen’s \\(d\\).

    "section": "8.3 Repeated Measures Designs",
    "text": "8.3 Repeated Measures Designs\nIn a repeated-measures design, the same subjects (or items, etc.) are measured on two or more separate occasions, or in multiple conditions within a single session, and we want to know the mean difference between those occasions or conditions (Baayen, Davidson, and Bates 2008; Barr et al. 2013). An example of this would be in a pre/post comparison where subjects are tested before and after undergoing some treatment (see Figure 8.1 for a visualization). A standardized mean difference in a repeated-measures design can take on a few different forms that we define below.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Figure displaying simulated data of a repeated measures design, the x-axis shows the condition (e.g., pre-test and post-test) and y-axis is the scores. Lines connect the change within subject from one condition to the next.\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.1 Difference Score \\(d\\) (\\(d_z\\))\nInstead of comparing the means of two sets of scores, a within subject design allows us to subtract the scores obtained in condition 1 from the scores in condition 2. These difference scores (\\(X_{\\text{diff}}=X_2-X_1\\)) can be used similarly to the single group design (if the target value was zero, i.e., \\(C=0\\)) such that,\n\\[\nd_z = \\frac{M_{\\text{diff}}}{S_{\\text{diff}}}\n\\]\nWhere the difference between this formulation and the single group design is the nature of the scores (difference scores rather than raw scores). The convenient thing about \\(d_z\\) is that it has a straight-forward relationship with the \\(t\\)-statistic, \\(d_z=\\frac{t}{\\sqrt{n}}\\). This makes it very useful for power analyses. If the standard deviation of difference scores are not accessible, then it can be calculated using the standard deviation of condition 1 (\\(S_1\\)), the standard deviation of condition 2 (\\(S_2\\)), and the correlation between conditions (\\(r\\)):\n\\[\nS_{\\text{diff}}=\\sqrt{S^2_1 + S^2_2 - 2 r S_1 S_2}\n\\]\nIt is important to note that when the correlation between groups is large, then the \\(d_z\\) value will also be larger, whereas a small correlation will return a smaller \\(d_z\\) value. The standard error of \\(d_z\\) can be calculated similarly to the single group design such that,\n\\[\nSE_{d_z} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{d_z^2}{2n}}\n\\]\nIn R, we can use the d.ind.t.diff function from the MOTE package to calculate \\(d_z\\).\n\n# Cohen's dz for difference scores\n# given difference score means and SDs\n\n# For example:\n# Difference Score Mean = 21.4, SD = 19.59, N = 96\n\nlibrary(MOTE)\n\nstats &lt;- d.dep.t.diff(\n  m = 21.4,\n  sd = 19.59,\n  n = 96,\n  a = 0.05\n)\n\n# print just the d value and confidence intervals\ndata.frame(d = apa(stats$d), \n           dlow = apa(stats$dlow), \n           dhigh = apa(stats$dhigh))\n\n      d  dlow dhigh\n1 1.092 0.837 1.344\n\n\nThe output shows that the effect size is \\(d_z\\) = 1.09, 95% CI [0.84, 1.34].\n\n\n8.3.2 Repeated Measures \\(d\\) (\\(d_{rm}\\))\nFor a within-group design, we want to compare the means of scores obtained from condition 1 and condition 2. The repeated measures standardized mean difference between the two conditions can be calculated by,\n\\[\nd_{rm} = \\frac{M_2-M_1}{S_w}.\n\\]\nA positive \\(d_{rm}\\) value would indicate that the mean of condition 2 is larger than the mean of condition 1. The standardizer here is the within-subject standard deviation, \\(S_w\\). The within-subject standard deviation can be defined as,\n\\[\nS_{\\text{diff}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{S^2_1 + S^2_2 - 2 r S_1 S_2}{2(1-r)}}.\n\\]\nWe can also express \\(S_w\\) in terms of \\(S_{\\text{diff}}\\),\n\\[\nS_w = \\frac{S_{\\text{diff}}}{ \\sqrt{2(1-r)} }.\n\\]\nFurthermore, we can even express \\(d_{rm}\\) in terms of \\(d_z\\),\n\\[\nd_{rm} = d_z \\times \\sqrt{2(1-r)}.\n\\]\nUltimately the \\(d_{rm}\\) is more appropriate as an effect size estimate for use in meta-analysis whereas \\(d_z\\) is more appropriate for power analysis (Lakens 2013). The standard error for \\(d_{rm}\\) can be computed as,\n\\[\nSE_{d_{rm}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{d^2_{rm}}{2n}\\right) \\times 2(1-r)}\n\\]\nIn R, we can use the d.ind.t.rm function from the MOTE package to calculate the repeated measures standardized mean difference (\\(d_{rm}\\)).\n\n# Cohen's d for repeated measures\n# given means and SDs and correlation\n\n# For example:\n# Condition 1 Mean = 30.4, SD = 22.53, N = 96\n# Condition 2 Mean = 21.4, SD = 19.59, N = 96\n# correlation between conditions: r = .40\n\nstats &lt;- d.dep.t.rm(\n  m1 = 30.4,\n  m2 = 21.4,\n  sd1 = 22.53,\n  sd2 = 19.59,\n  r = .40,\n  n = 96,\n  a = 0.05\n)\n\n# print just the d value and confidence intervals\ndata.frame(d = apa(stats$d), \n           dlow = apa(stats$dlow), \n           dhigh = apa(stats$dhigh))\n\n      d  dlow dhigh\n1 0.425 0.215 0.633\n\n\nThe output shows that the effect size is \\(d_{rm}\\) = 0.42, 95% CI [0.21, 0.63].\n\n\n8.3.3 Average Variance \\(d\\) (\\(d_{av}\\))\nThe problem with \\(d_{z}\\) and \\(d_{rm}\\), is that they require the correlation between conditions. In practice, correlations between conditions are frequently not reported. An alternative estimator of Cohen’s \\(d\\) in repeated measures design is to simply use the classic variation of cohen’s \\(d\\) (i.e., pooled standard deviation). In a repeated measures design, the sample size does not change between conditions. Therefore weighting the variance of condition 1 and condition 2 by their respective degrees of freedom (i.e., \\(df=n-1\\)) is an unnecessary step. Instead, we can standardize by the square root of the average the variances of condition 1 and 2:\n\\[\nd_{av} = \\frac{M_2 - M_1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{S_1^2 + S_2^2}{2}}}\n\\]\nThis formulation is convenient especially when the correlation is not present, however without the correlation it fails to take into account the consistency of change between conditions. The standard error of the \\(d_{av}\\) can be expressed as,\n\\[\nSE_{d_{av}}= \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n} + \\frac{d^2_{av}}{4n}}\n\\]\nIn R, we can use the d.ind.t.rm function from the MOTE package to calculate the repeated measures standardized mean difference (\\(d_{rm}\\)).\n\n# Cohen's d for repeated measures (average variance)\n# given means and SDs \n\n# For example:\n# Condition 1 Mean = 30.4, SD = 22.53, N = 96\n# Condition 2 Mean = 21.4, SD = 19.59, N = 96\n\nstats &lt;- d.dep.t.avg(\n  m1 = 30.4,\n  m2 = 21.4,\n  sd1 = 22.53,\n  sd2 = 19.59,\n  n = 96,\n  a = 0.05\n)\n\n# print just the d value and confidence intervals\ndata.frame(d = apa(stats$d), \n           dlow = apa(stats$dlow), \n           dhigh = apa(stats$dhigh))\n\n      d  dlow dhigh\n1 0.427 0.217 0.635\n\n\nThe output shows that the effect size is \\(d_{av}\\) = 0.43, 95% CI [0.22, 0.64].\n\n\n8.3.4 Becker’s \\(d\\) (\\(d_b\\))\nAn even simpler variant of repeated measures \\(d\\) value comes from Becker (1988). Becker’s \\(d\\) standardizes simply by the pre-test standard deviation when the comparison is a pre/post design,\n\\[\nd_b = \\frac{M_{\\text{post}}-M_{\\text{pre}}}{S_{\\text{pre}}}.\n\\]\nThe convenient interpretation of “change in baseline standard deviations” can be quite useful. We can also obtain the standard error with,\n\\[\nSE_{d_b} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(1-r)}{n}+\\frac{d_b^2}{2n}}\n\\] Notice that even though the formula for calculating \\(d_b\\) did not include the correlation coefficient, the standard error does.\nIn base R, we can calculate Becker’s formulation of standardized mean difference using the equations above.\n\n# Install the package below if not done so already\n# install.packages(escalc)\n# Cohen's d for repeated measures (becker's d)\n# given means, the pre-test SDs, and the correlation\n\n# For example:\n# Pre-test Mean = 21.4, SD = 19.59, N = 96\n# Post-test Mean = 30.4, N = 96\n# Correlation between conditions: r = .40\n\nMpre &lt;- 21.4\nMpost &lt;- 30.4\nSpre &lt;- 19.59\nr &lt;- .40\nn &lt;- 96\na &lt;- 0.05\n\nd &lt;- (Mpost - Mpre) / Spre\n\nSE &lt;- sqrt( 2*(1-r)/n + d^2/(2*n) )\n\nstats &lt;- data.frame(d = d,\n                    dlow = d - 1.96*SE,\n                    dhigh = d + 1.96*SE)\n\n# print just the d value and confidence intervals\ndata.frame(d = apa(d), \n           dlow = apa(d - 1.96*SE), \n           dhigh = apa(d + 1.96*SE))\n\n      d  dlow dhigh\n1 0.459 0.231 0.688\n\n\nThe output shows that the effect size is \\(d_{rm}\\) = 0.46, 95% CI [0.23, 0.69].\n\n\n8.3.5 Comparing Repeated Measures \\(d\\) values\nFigure 8.2 shows repeated measures designs with a high (\\(r=\\) .95) and low (\\(r=\\) .05) correlation between conditions. Let us fix the standard deviations and means for both conditions (i.e., high and low correlation) and only vary the correlation. Now we can compare the repeated measures estimators based on these two conditions shown in Figure 8.2:\n\nHigh correlation:\n\n\\(d_z=1.24\\)\n\\(d_{rm}=0.39\\)\n\\(d_{av}=0.43\\)\n\\(d_{b}=0.40\\)\n\nLow correlation:\n\n\\(d_z=0.31\\)\n\\(d_{rm}=0.43\\)\n\\(d_{av}=0.43\\)\n\\(d_{b}=0.40\\)\n\n\nWe notice that the correlation greatly influences \\(d_z\\) more than any other estimator. The \\(d_{rm}\\) value has very little change, whereas \\(d_{av}\\) and \\(d_{b}\\) do not take into account the correlation at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: Figure displaying simulated data of a repeated measures design, the x-axis shows the condition (e.g., pre-test and post-test) and y-axis is the scores.

To adjust for this bias, we can apply a correction factor based on the degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom will largely depend on the estimator used. The degrees of freedom for each estimator is listed below:\n\nSingle Group design (\\(d_s\\)): \\(df = n-1\\)\nBetween Groups - Pooled Standard Deviation (\\(d_p\\)): \\(df = n_1+n_2-2\\)\nBetween Groups - Control Group Standard Deviation (\\(d_\\Delta\\)): \\(df = n_C-1\\)\nRepeated Measures - all types (\\(d_z\\), \\(d_{rm}\\), \\(d_{av}\\), \\(d_{b}\\)): \\(df = n-1\\)\n\nWith the appropriate degrees of freedom, we can use the following correction factor, \\(CF\\), to obtain an unbiased estimate of the population standardized mean difference:\n\\[\nCF = \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{df}{2}\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{df-1}{2}\\right)\\sqrt{\\frac{df}{2}}}\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\Gamma(\\cdot)\\) is the gamma function.

    "text": "To quantify the relationship between two continuous variables, the most common method is to use a Pearson correlation coefficient (denoted with the letter \\(r\\)). The pearson correlation takes the covariance between a continuous independent (\\(X\\)) and dependent (\\(Y\\)) variable and standardizes it by the standard deviations of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\),\n\\[\nr = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{S_{X} S_{Y}}.\n\\]\nWe can visualize what a correlation between two variables looks like with scatter plots. Figure 9.1 shows scatter plots with differing levels of correlation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: Simulated data from a bivariate normal distribution displaying 6 different correlations, r = 0, .20, .40, .60, .80, and 1.00.\n\n\n\n\nThe standard error of the Pearson correlation coefficient is,\n\\[\nSE_r = \\frac{1-r^2}{\\sqrt{n-1}}\n\\]\nUnlike Cohen’s \\(d\\) and other effect size measures, The correlation coefficient is bounded by -1 and positive 1, with positive 1 being a perfectly positive correlation, -1 being a perfectly negative correlation, and zero indicating no correlation between the two variables. The bounding has the consequence of making the confidence interval asymmetric around \\(r\\) (e.g., if the correlation is positive, the lower bound is farther away from \\(r\\) than the upper bound is). It is important to note that with a correlation of zero, the confidence interval is symmetric and approximately normal. Instead, to obtain the confidence intervals of \\(r\\), we first need to apply a Fisher’s Z transformation. A Fisher’s Z transformation is a hyperbolic arctangent transformation of a Pearson correlation coefficient and can be computed as,\n\\[\nZ_r = \\text{arctanh}(r)\n\\]\nThe Fisher Z transformation ensures \\(Z_r\\) has a symmetric and approximately normal sampling distribution. This then allows us to calculate the confidence interval from the standard error of \\(Z_r\\) (\\(SE_{Z_r} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n-3}}\\)). We can also back-transform the confidence into a Pearson correlation scale,\n\\[\nCI_{r} = \\text{tanh}(Z_r \\pm 1.96\\times SE_{Z_r})\n\\]\nWe can then back-transform the upper bound and lower bound into the upper and lower bound of \\(r\\) by taking the hyperbolic tangent (the inverse of the arctangent).\nIn R, the full process of obtaining confidence intervals can be done quite easily. Note if you have raw data for \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), then you can compute the correlation with base R, cor(X,Y).\n\n# example: r = .50, n = 50\nr &lt;- .50\nn &lt;- 50\n\n# compute Zr\nZr &lt;- atanh(r)\n\n# calculate standard error of Zr\nSE_Zr &lt;- 1/sqrt(n-3)\n\n# compute confidence interval of Zr\nZlow &lt;- Zr - 1.96 * SE_Zr\nZhigh &lt;- Zr + 1.96 * SE_Zr\n\n# backtransform CI of Z to CI of Pearson correlation\nrlow &lt;- tanh(Zlow) \nrhigh &lt;- tanh(Zhigh)\n\n# print pearson correlation and confidence intervals\ndata.frame(r = MOTE::apa(r), \n           rlow = MOTE::apa(rlow), \n           rhigh = MOTE::apa(rhigh))\n\n      r  rlow rhigh\n1 0.500 0.257 0.683\n\n\nThe output shows that the correlation and its confidence intervals are \\(r\\) = 0.50, 95% CI [0.26, 0.68]."

Also, the sign of \\(r\\) indicates the direction of association, whereas to get the direction of an association given a 2 by 2 contingency table, we need to look at the table itself; phi only provides a measure of strength.

It is commonly used in medical and behavioral intervention research, and notably, in meta-analysis.\nLet’s imagine a study conducted to investigate the association between smoking and the development of major depressive disorder (MDD). The study includes a sample of 251 individuals, categorizing them into two groups: 125 smokers and 126 non-smokers. The researchers are interested in understanding the odds of having major depressive disorder (MDD) among smokers compared to non-smokers. Say we find that 25 smokers were diagnosed with MDD while 100 were not, but in the non-smoker group, 12 individuals were diagnosed with MDD while 120 were not. The odds ratio would then be:\n\\[\nOR = \\frac{25/100}{12/120}= \\frac{.25}{.10} = 2.50\n\\]\nIn general, we can can compute the odds-ratio from a contingency table between binary variables \\(X\\) (i.e., the treatment) and \\(Y\\) (i.e., the outcome; see Table 10.3).\n\n\nTable 10.3: Contingency table between two binary variables\n\n\n\n\\(X=T\\)\n\\(X=C\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(Y=0\\)\n\\(n_{T0}\\)\n\\(n_{C0}\\)\n\n\n\\(Y=1\\)\n\\(n_{T1}\\)\n\\(n_{C1}\\)\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, we want to compare the outcome between the treatment group (\\(X=T\\)) and the control group (\\(X=C\\)).

It describes the proportion of the total variability in the data that are accounted for by a particular factor. Therefore, it is a measure of variance explained. To calculate eta-squared (\\(\\eta^2\\)) we need to first calculate the total sum of squares (\\(SS_{\\text{total}}\\)) and the effect sum of squares (\\(SS_{\\text{effect}}\\)),\n\\[\nSS_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\\bar{y})^2\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\bar{y}\\) is the grand mean (i.e., the mean of all data points collapsed across groups). To calculate the sum of squares of the effect, we can take the predicted \\(y\\) values (\\(\\hat{y}_i\\)). In the case of categorical predictors, \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) is equal to the mean of the outcome within that individual’s respective group. Therefore the sum of squares of the effect can be calculated using the following formula:\n\\[\nSS_{\\text{effect}} = \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\hat{y}_i-\\bar{y})^2.\n\\]\nNow we can calculate the eta-squared value,\n\\[\n\\eta^2 = \\frac{SS_{\\text{effect}}}{SS_{\\text{total}}}\n\\]\nThe standard error of eta-square can be approximated from Olkin and Finn (1995):\n\\[\nSE_{\\eta^2}=\\sqrt{\\frac{4\\eta^2\\left(1-\\eta^2\\right)^2\\left(n+k-1\\right)^2}{\\left(n^2-1\\right)\\left(3+n\\right)}}\n\\]\nThe sampling distribution for \\(\\eta^2\\) is asymmetric as all the values are bounded in the range, 0 to 1. The confidence interval surrounding \\(\\eta^2\\) will likewise be asymmetric so instead of calculating the confidence interval from the standard error, we can instead use a non-central F-distribution using the degrees of freedom between groups (e.g., for three groups: \\(df_b=k-1=3-1=2\\)) and the degrees of freedom within groups (e.g., for 100 subjects and three groups: \\(df_b=n-k=100-3=97\\)) to obtain the confidence intervals. Another option is to use bootstrapping procedure (i.e., resampling the observed data points to construct a sampling distribution around \\(\\eta^2\\), see Kirby and Gerlanc 2013) and then take the .025 and .975 quantiles of that distribution. The R code below will compute the proper confidence interval.\nWhere \\(n\\) is the total sample size and \\(k\\) is the number of predictors. In R, we can calculate \\(\\eta^2\\) from a one-way ANOVA using the penguin data set from the palmerpenguins data package. The aov function in base R allows the analyst to model an ANOVA with categorical predictors on the right side (species) of the ~ and the outcome on the left side (body mass of penguin). We can then use the eta_squared function in the effectsize package to calculate the point estimate and confidence intervals.\n\n# Example:\n# group: species\n# outcome: body mass\n\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\nlibrary(effectsize)\n\n# One-Way ANOVA\nmdl1 &lt;- aov(data = penguins,\n           body_mass_g ~ species)\n\neta_squared(mdl1, \n            partial = FALSE,\n            alternative = \"two.sided\")\n\n# Effect Size for ANOVA (Type I)\n\nParameter | Eta2 |       95% CI\n-------------------------------\nspecies   | 0.67 | [0.62, 0.71]\n\n\nThe species of the penguin explains the majority of the variation in body mass showing an eta-squared value of \\(\\eta^2\\) = .67 [.62, .71].

The biggest advantage of generalized eta-squared is that it facilitates meta-analysis, which is important for the accumulation of knowledge. To calculate generalized eta-squared, the denominator should be the sums of squares of all the non-manipulated variables (i.e., variance of purely individual differences in the outcome rather than individual differences in treatment effects).

The confidence intervals for Cohen’s \\(f\\) can be computed from the upper bounds and lower bounds of the confidence intervals from eta-square or omega-square using the formulas to calculate \\(f\\) (e.g., for the upper bound \\(f_{UP} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\eta^2_{UP}}{1-\\eta^2_{UP}}}\\)).\nIn R, we can use the cohens_f function in the effectsize package to calculate Cohen’s \\(f\\).

    "text": "11.5 Reporting ANOVA results\nFor ANOVAs/F-tests, you will always need to report two kinds of effects: the omnibus effect of the factor(s) and the effect of planned contrasts or post hoc comparisons.\nFor instance, imagine that you are comparing three groups/conditions with a one-way ANOVA. The ANOVA will first return an F-statistic, the degrees of freedom, and the associated p-value. Here, you need to calculate the size of this omnibus factor effect in eta-squared, partial eta-squared, or generalized eta-squared. Suppose the omnibus effect is significant. You now know that there is at least one group that differs from the others. You want to know which group(s) differ from the others, and how much they differ. Therefore, you conduct post hoc comparisons on these groups. Because post hoc comparisons compare each group with the others in pairs, you will get a t-statistic and p-value for each comparison. For this, you need to calculate and report Cohen’s \\(d\\) or Hedges’ \\(g\\).\nImagine that you have two independent variables or factors, and you conduct a two-by-two factorial ANOVA. The first thing to do then is look at the interaction. If the interaction is significant, you again report the associated omnibus effect size measures, and proceed to analyze the simple effects. Depending on your research question, you compare the levels of one IV on each level of the other IV. You will report d or g for these simple effects. If the interaction is not significant, you look at the main effects and report the associated omnibus effect. You then proceed to analyze the main effect by comparing the levels of one IV while collapsing/aggregating the levels of the other IV. You will report \\(d\\) or \\(g\\) for these pairwise comparisons.\nNote that lower-order effects are not directly interpretable if higher-order effects are significant. If you have a significant interaction in a two-way ANOVA, you cannot interpret the main effects directly. If you have a significant three-way interaction in a three-way ANOVA, you cannot interpret the main effects or the two-way interactions directly, regardless of whether they are significant or not.\nIn R, we can use the summary function to display the anova table.

    "section": "13.2 Brunner-Munzel Tests",
    "text": "13.2 Brunner-Munzel Tests\nBrunner-Munzel’s tests can be used instead of the WMW tests. The primary reason is the interpretation of the test (Munzel and Brunner 2002; Brunner and Munzel 2000; Neubert and Brunner 2007). Recently, Karch (2021) argued that the Mann-Whitney test is not a decent test of equality of medians, distributions or stochastic equality. The Brunner-Munzel test, on the other hand, provides a sensible approach to test for stochastic equality.\nThe Brunner-Munzel tests measure a rank based “relative effect” or “stochastic superiority probability”. The test statistic (\\(\\hat p\\)) is essentially the probability of a value in one condition being greater than other while splitting the ties1. However, Brunner-Munzel tests can not be applied to the single group or one-sample designs.\n\\[\n\\hat{p} = P(X&lt;Y)+ \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot P(X=Y)\n\\]\nThese tests are relatively new so there are very few packages offer Brunner-Munzel. Moreover, Karch (2021) argues that the stochastic superiority effect size (\\(\\hat{p}\\)) offers a nuanced way to interpret group differences by visualizing observations as competitors in a contest. Propounded by scholars like Cliff (1993) and Divine et al. (2018), it views each observation from one group in a duel with every observation from another. If an observation from the first group surpasses its counterpart, it “wins,” and the group garners a point; tied observations yield half a point to each group. This concept can be further elucidated through a bubble plot, where placement above, below, or on the diagonal indicates the dominance of one group’s observation over the other. Other interpretations, like transforming p to the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW) odds or Cliff’s δ offer deeper insights.

    "text": "13.3 Rank-Based Effect Sizes\nSince the mean and standard deviation are not estimated for a WMW or Brunner-Munzel test, it would be inappropriate to present a standardized mean difference (e.g., Cohen’s d) to accompany these tests. Instead, a rank based effect size (i.e., based on the ranks of the observed values) can be reported to accompany the non-parametric statistical tests.\n\n13.3.1 Rank-Biserial Correlation\nThe rank-biserial correlation (\\(r_{rb}\\)) is considered a measure of dominance. The correlation represents the difference between the proportion of favorable and unfavorable pairs or signed ranks. Larger values indicate that more of X is larger than more of Y, with a value of (−1) indicates that all observations in the second, \\(Y\\), group are larger than the first, \\(X\\), group, and a value of (+1) indicates that all observations in the first group are larger than the second.\n\nPaired Samples Calculation\n\nCalculate difference scores between pairs:\n\n\\[\nD = X_2 - X_1\n\\]\n\nCalculate the positive and negative rank sums:\n\n\\[\n\\text{When } D_i&gt;0,\\;\\;  R_{\\oplus} = \\sum_{i=1} -1\\cdot \\text{sign}(D_i) \\cdot \\text{rank}(|D_i|)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{When } D_i&lt;0,\\;\\;  R_{\\ominus} = \\sum_{i=1} -1\\cdot \\text{sign}(D_i) \\cdot \\text{rank}(|D_i|)\n\\]\n\nWe can set a constant, \\(H\\), to be -1 when the rank positive rank sum is greater than or equal to the negative rank sum (\\(R_{\\oplus} \\ge R_{\\ominus}\\)) or we can set \\(H\\) to 1 when the rank positive rank sum is less than the negative rank sum (\\(R_{\\oplus} &lt; R_{\\ominus}\\)).\n\n\\[\nH = \\begin{cases} -1 &  R_{\\oplus} \\ge  R_{\\ominus} \\\\ 1 & R_{\\oplus} &lt; R_{\\ominus} \\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nCalculate rank-biserial correlation:\n\n\\[\nr_{rb} = 4H\\times \\left| \\frac{\\min( R_{\\oplus}, R_{\\ominus}) - .5\\times ( R_{\\oplus} +  R_{\\ominus})}{n(n + 1)} \\right|\n\\]\n\nFor paired samples, or one sample, the standard error is calculated as the following:\n\n\\[\nSE_{r_{rb}} = \\sqrt{ \\frac {(2 \\cdot nd^3 + 3 \\cdot nd^2 + nd) / 6} {(nd^2 + nd) / 2} }\n\\] 6.

In the two sample case, this is roughly equivalent to the statistic of the Brunner-Munzel test. In the paired sample case, it is the probability that a randomly chosen difference score (\\(D\\)) will have a positive (+) sign plus 0.5 times the probability of a tie (no/zero difference). The concordance probability can go by many names. It is also referred to as the c-index, the non-parametric probability of superiority, or the non-parametric common language effect size (CLES).\n\nCalculation\nThe calculation of concordance can be derived from the rank-biserial correlation. The concordance probability (\\(p_c\\)) can be converted from the correlation.\n\\[\np_c = \\frac{r_{rb} + 1 }{2}\n\\]\n\n\nCalculation in R\n\n# Paired samples\n\ndata(sleep)\n\nses_calc(extra ~ group,\n         data = sleep,\n         paired = TRUE,\n         ses = \"c\")\n\n             estimate  lower.ci  upper.ci conf.level\nConcordance 0.9909091 0.9641845 0.9977392       0.95\n\n# Two Sample\n# data import from likert\ndata(mass, package = \"likert\")\ndf_mass = mass |&gt;\n  as.data.frame() |&gt;\n  janitor::clean_names()\n\nses_calc(rank(math_relates_to_my_life) ~ gender,\n         data = df_mass,\n         ses = \"c\")\n\n             estimate  lower.ci  upper.ci conf.level\nConcordance 0.2738095 0.1084217 0.5389723       0.95\n\n\n\n\n\n13.3.3 Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Odds\nThe Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney odds (O’Brien and Castelloe 2006), also known as the “Generalized Odds Ratio”(Agresti 1980), essentially transforms the concordance probability into an odds ratio.\n\nCalculation\nThe odds can be converted from the concordance by taking the logit of the concordance. This will provide the log odds. The exponential value of the log-odds will provide the odds on a more interpretable scale.\n\\[\nO_{WMW} = \\exp \\left[\\text{logit}(p_c)\\right]\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log(O_{WMW}) = \\text{logit}(p_c)\n\\]\n\n\nCalculation in R\n\n# Paired samples ----\n\ndata(sleep)\n\nTOSTER::ses_calc(extra ~ group,\n                       data = sleep,\n                       paired = TRUE,\n                 ses = \"odds\")\n\n         estimate lower.ci upper.ci conf.level\nWMW Odds      109 26.92087 441.3305       0.95\n\n# Two Sample ------\n# data import from likert\ndata(mass, package = \"likert\")\ndf_mass = mass |&gt;\n  as.data.frame() |&gt;\n  janitor::clean_names()\n\nTOSTER::ses_calc(  rank(math_relates_to_my_life) ~ gender,\n  data = df_mass,\n                 ses = \"odds\")\n\n          estimate  lower.ci upper.ci conf.level\nWMW Odds 0.3770492 0.1216064 1.169067       0.95\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgresti, Alan. 1980. “Generalized Odds Ratios for Ordinal Data.” Biometrics, 59–67.\n\n\nBrunner, Edgar, and Ullrich Munzel. 2000. “The Nonparametric Behrens-Fisher Problem: Asymptotic Theory and a Small-Sample Approximation.” Biometrical Journal 42 (1): 17–25. https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1521-4036(200001)42:1&lt;17::AID-BIMJ17&gt;3.0.CO;2-U.\n\n\nCaldwell, Aaron R. 2022. “Exploring Equivalence Testing with the Updated TOSTER r Package.” PsyArXiv. https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/ty8de.\n\n\nCliff, Norman. 1993. “Dominance Statistics: Ordinal Analyses to Answer Ordinal Questions.” Psychological Bulletin 114 (3): 494.\n\n\nDivine, George W, H James Norton, Anna E Barón, and Elizabeth Juarez-Colunga. 2018. “The Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney Procedure Fails as a Test of Medians.” The American Statistician 72 (3): 278–86.\n\n\nKarch, Julian D. 2021. “Psychologists Should Use Brunner-Munzel’s Instead of Mann-Whitney’s u Test as the Default Nonparametric Procedure.” Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science 4 (2): 2515245921999602.\n\n\nLäkens, Daniel. 2017. “Equivalence Tests: A Practical Primer for t-Tests, Correlations, and Meta-Analyses.” Social Psychological and Personality Science 1: 1–8. https://doi.org/10.1177/1948550617697177.\n\n\nLiddell, Torrin M., and John K.

    "text": "17.1 Limitations and Future Directions\nWhile this guide covers a wide range of effect size and confidence interval methods, there are some limitations to note. First, our instructions focus specifically on applications in behavioral, cognitive, and social science research. The techniques may need to be adapted for other scientific domains. Second, we only cover free and open source options, so proprietary software packages are not discussed. Finally, as new methods and R packages arise, the guide will need to be continually updated, perhaps in a similar manner as Parsons et al. (2022) Open Scholarship terms after publication.\nIn the future, we aim to expand the guide by collaborating with experts in other fields to include discipline-specific recommendations. We also plan to incorporate new R packages and techniques as they emerge. Readers are encouraged to consult the cited packages’ documentation and peer-reviewed sources to further explore limitations and assumptions of the covered techniques."

With this collaborative collection of applied instructions, our guide aims to make calculating effect sizes and confidence intervals more accessible. We hope these resources empower both young researchers and experienced scholars across a variety of disciplines to incorporate these crucial statistical practices into their workflows. In our view, more widespread and thoughtful adoption of these methods will greatly strengthen the collective rigor, transparency, and impact of scientific research."
