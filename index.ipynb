        "This effect sizes and confidence intervals collaborative guide aims to provide academics, students and researchers with hands-on, step-by-step instructions for calculating effect sizes and confidence intervals for common statistical tests used in the behavioral, cognitive and social sciences, particularly when original data are not available and when reported information is incomplete. It also introduces general background information on effect sizes and confidence intervals, as well as useful R packages for their calculation. Many of the methods and procedures described in this Guide are based on R or R-based Shiny Apps developed by the science community. We were motivated to focus on R as we aim to maximize the reproducibility of our research outcomes and encourage the most reproducible study planning and data analysis workflow, though we also document other methods whenever possible for the reference of our readers. We regularly update this open educational resource, as packages are updated frequently and new packages are developed from time to time in this rapidly changing Open Scholarship era.\n",

        "Effect sizes and confidence intervals are critical metrics for interpreting results and quantifying the magnitude of findings in scientific research. However, calculating these values can be challenging, particularly when original data are unavailable or results are incompletely reported in prior publications. To address this need, our collaborative guide provides hands-on instructions for calculating effect sizes and confidence intervals for common statistical tests in the behavioral, cognitive, and social sciences. Our guide includes background information on these concepts as well as recommendations for useful R packages that can automate many of these computations. R is emphasized due to its capabilities for reproducible analyses; however, we also cover alternative methods for those without expertise in R. This guide is intended to be an evolving open educational resource, updated as new methods and packages become available in this fast-changing era of open scholarship. By compiling these applied instructions, our goal is to enable students and researchers to easily obtain these metrics, facilitating robust and transparent quantification of results, as well as cumulative scientific progress.\n",
