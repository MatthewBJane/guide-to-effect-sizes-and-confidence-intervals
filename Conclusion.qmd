## Limitations and Future Directions

While this guide covers a wide range of effect size and confidence interval methods, there are some limitations to note. First, our instructions focus specifically on applications in behavioral, cognitive, and social science research. The techniques may need to be adapted for other scientific domains. Second, we only cover free and open source options, so proprietary software packages are not discussed. Finally, as new methods and R packages arise, the guide will need to be continually updated, perhaps in a similar manner as Parsons et al. (2022) Open Scholarship terms after publication.

In the future, we aim to expand the guide by collaborating with experts in other fields to include discipline-specific recommendations. We also plan to incorporate new R packages and techniques as they emerge. Readers are encouraged to consult the cited packages' documentation and peer-reviewed sources to further explore limitations and assumptions of the covered techniques.

## Conclusion

Robust quantification of study results is a central pillar of open and reproducible science. With this collaborative collection of applied instructions, our guide aims to make calculating effect sizes and confidence intervals more accessible. We hope these resources empower both young researchers and experienced scholars across a variety of disciplines to incorporate these crucial statistical practices into their workflows. In our view, more widespread and thoughtful adoption of these methods will greatly strengthen the collective rigor, transparency, and impact of scientific research.
